# FAQ Accordion

## A drop-down FAQ component challenge from www.frontendmentor.com

This responsive credit card information component was designed according to UX specs on www.frontendmentor.com.

This was a fun step up, in terms of integrating more JS and flexing (as well as flexboxing) some more interactive CSS. Overflow was not something I'd ever explored before, and is something I wish I'd understood before. No more box-y design for me.

### New Discoveries

I completed the whole thing before a kind soul pointed me in the direction of the <details> element. While there was a small facepalm moment, I'm glad to have built an elegant solution myself. Who wants to always take the easy, cheap route?

Employers do. And that's why I'll be using <details> in the future.

### Technologies

* HTML5.
* Vanilla CSS3.
* JavaScript.
